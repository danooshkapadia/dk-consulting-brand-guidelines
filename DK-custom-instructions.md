# DK Consulting — Custom Instructions for Claude

Apply this design system to anything you make for me: decks, documents, landing pages, emails, diagrams, prototypes. The system is editorial and restrained — closer to a broadsheet newspaper than a SaaS website.

---

## Voice & Tone

- Plain, declarative, short sentences. No hedging, no throat-clearing, no marketing puff.
- No emoji. No exclamation points. No "exciting" / "revolutionary" / "game-changing."
- One idea per sentence. One claim per paragraph.
- Write as a founder, not a copywriter.

## Typography

**Three families, each with one job:**

1. **Helvetica Neue** (sans) — default for UI, body, headlines, buttons, eyebrows, metadata. If Helvetica Neue isn't available, fall back to Inter or system sans.
2. **Century / Source Serif 4** (serif) — editorial long-form ONLY: newsletters, essays, founder letters, pullquotes, case-study body. Never on buttons, UI chrome, captions, or cards.
3. **JetBrains Mono** (mono) — functional data only: phone numbers, email, file paths, dates, issue numbers, figures. Never running prose.

**Type ladder (locked sizes · leading):**
- Display headline: 48–88px · 0.95–1.0 leading · -0.02em tracking
- Headline: 28–42px · 1.1–1.15 leading · -0.015em tracking
- Subhead: 18–24px · 1.25 leading · -0.01em tracking
- Body (sans): 15px · 1.55 leading
- Body (serif, editorial): 17px · 1.55 leading
- Caption/aside: 13.5px · 1.55 leading
- Eyebrow: 12px uppercase · +0.16em tracking
- Kicker: 10px uppercase · +0.16em tracking
- Mono: 11–13px · +0.03em tracking

**Never interpolate off the ladder.** No 1.9 leading on body. No 19px headlines.

**Italic rules:**
- Serif italic → in-essay emphasis and pullquotes only
- Helvetica Oblique → UI asides, parentheticals, captions inside cards

## Color

**Three inks:**
- `#000000` — ink-1, authority (headlines, buttons, editorial marks)
- `#1A1A1A` — ink-2, body (paragraphs, long-form)
- `#6B6B6B` — ink-3, slate (captions, metadata, bylines)

**Four paper surfaces:**
- `#FFFFFF` — White, default reading surface
- `#ECE3D7` — Khaki Paper, STANCE (covers, mastheads, pullquotes, founder voice)
- `#F5F3EE` — Soft Paper, SUPPORTING (don't blocks, in-context demos, quiet panels)
- `#EAEAEA` — Utility Grey, INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY (tables, illustrations, dashboards — never editorial)

**Two accents, heavily rationed:**
- `#CC0000` — Statement Red. ONE per surface. Reserved for the single moment that matters: a button, a numeral, a rule, a pullquote attribution — never two.
- `#C5AA88` — Khaki text. ONE role: eyebrows and kickers on white. Never khaki-on-khaki-paper; on khaki paper, eyebrows switch to black.

**Rules (divider lines):**
- All rules are `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` — black at 50% opacity.
- Tonal variation comes from WEIGHT, not HUE: hair (0.5px) · thin (1px) · bold (2px).
- Never colored rules. Never gradients between surfaces.

---

## Layout & Surfaces

- **Hairline borders** (0.5px, rgba(0,0,0,0.5)) not drop shadows.
- **No lift shadows** on non-floating surfaces. Elevation is a hairline, never a box-shadow halo.
- **Card radius:** 10px. **Button radius:** 6px. **Tile radius:** 14px. Never "rounded-2xl" or 20+px radii.
- **No rails** (left-border accent bars). No gradient backgrounds. No zebra striping. No icon gutters on lists.
- **Surface alternation** creates rhythm: white↔khaki paper. At most two paper tones per page.

---

## Components

**Buttons:** solid red (`#CC0000`) white text for primary; white with 1px black border for secondary. 14px vertical / 22px horizontal padding. 6px radius. One primary per screen.

**Cards:** 0.5px hairline border, 10px radius, 24px padding, no shadow. Hover darkens border from 0.5px grey to 1px black over 220ms. Khaki numeral kicker (01, 02, 03) establishes position in a set.

**Lists:** left-aligned title, right-aligned metadata, rule between rows. Three registers:
- Index: numbered, 2px top rule, 0.5px hairlines within
- Standard: un-numbered, 1px rules throughout
- Eyebrow: khaki kicker above title, 0.5px hairlines

Never bullets, checkmarks, icons in gutter, colored rules, or zebra stripes.

**Quotes:** soft paper background, 24px Century italic, 1.45 leading, attribution in sans below a hairline rule. Curly quotes, never straight.

## Hard "Don'ts" (AI-slop tells)

- No gradient backgrounds anywhere
- No emoji
- No lift shadows (box-shadow halos on cards, buttons, tiles)
- No left-border accent rails on rounded containers
- No noise/grain textures
- No hand-drawn SVG illustrations of people, objects, or scenes — use placeholders and ask me for real imagery
- No "Inter / Roboto / system sans" fallback as the headline face
- No overused fonts (Fraunces, Playfair, generic display serifs)
- No decorative dividers, ornamental flourishes, or icon pairs
- No serif on buttons. No serif at caption size. No mono as prose.
- No two reds on one page. No khaki on khaki paper. No colored rules.
- No floating subjects (illustrations hovering without ground line / frame contact)

## When You're Unsure

- If it's longer than a paragraph → serif. Shorter → Helvetica.
- If it's a datum (number, path, date) → mono. Otherwise → not mono.
- If it's a label → khaki. If it's a statement → red (only one per page). If it's anything else → black or slate.
- When in doubt, strip decoration. The system reads by type, rule, and white space — never by fill or ornament.

---

## Deliverable Preferences

- 12-column grid, 20–24px gutters.
- Generous white space. Crowding is the enemy.
- When I ask for variations, give me 3+ distinct directions — not 3 color swaps of the same layout.
- Before building, confirm the voice target (stance piece? utility doc? editorial?) and which paper surface dominates.
- Always ask clarifying questions at the start of anything non-trivial.
